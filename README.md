# Robo-Dodge-Game-Python

HELLO!

Here is a silly little game I made in Python

See how many blocks you can dodge as the blocks come down faster and faster!

Leader board coming soon so you can out-dodge your mates!

Enjoy :)

ps. It will also be available as an executable file at some point but for now
just download the files and run it from your Python interpreter if you want to 
play around
